/*The first snippet will output ocean = {prefix: 'Pacific'}
Snippet 2 will log an error because when we call an
object's parameter with the brackets, the key needs to be
in "". Wrong answer.
Snippet 1 is correct as I mentioned.
Snippet 2 will log {Indian: 'Pacific'}, because we are calling
the [prefix] without using the quotation mark, which means it
will call 'Indian' as the key because this is what got assigned
to prefix.
Bracket notation accepts expressions.
